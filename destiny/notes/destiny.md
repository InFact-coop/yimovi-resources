## synopsis

Tian Lin, Xi He’s mother, takes every opportunity she can to educate her son so that he can only comprehend the world around him but eventually live independently. Xi He’s father, Zhao Ju, however, is content for his son to attend a ‘special’ school and encourages Tian Lin to have a second child so that in the future Xi He will be cared for. After a series of incidents at the school a group of parents organise to have Xi He expelled. Tian Lin attempts to apologise and persuade other parents to sign a petition and while some show sympathy most of the parents dismiss her pleas.

Though a consultation with a doctor reveals that Xi He shows signs of intellectual improvement and is capable of learning, the school struggles to have him reinstated. Finally Xi He and Tian Lin are forcefully rejected by a group of aggrieved parents. The film then shifts to a remote and impoverished village where the family visits Tian Lin’s mother. There it is revealed that Tian Lin has an autistic elder brother, Tian Gui, who has escaped from his shackles. That evening the villagers round up Tian Gui and threaten to lock him permanently in a steel cage. Tian Lin’s elderly mother struggles to care her son yet does not entrust others to take responsibility for him.

Faced with the task of caring for two autistic family members, Tian Lin divulges that she was “born a slave” to attend to her brother following their parents death. The elderly mother states that it is her “fate”, or destiny as the title of the film suggests, to care for her family.

Tian Lin leaves behind her mother and brother and returns to Shenzhen where she takes on the role of a teacher to Xi He, not at a school, but on a subway platform. The mother and son attract the attention of the public and their story goes viral on social media, television, and newspapers prompting the local government to respond to Xi He’s situation.

A televised meeting between Tian Lin, the school headmaster, and government officials proceeds as each party debates the policies of integrated education and the challenges of balancing the rights of majority and minority groups. Tian Lin makes a plea for the public to understand, accept, and integrate people with autism into ‘normal’ society, however, Xi He is not admitted back at the school.

Finally, Tian Lin quits her job at the bank and assumes full responsibility for educating Xi He.


## Context

Zhang Wei is an independent filmmaker devoted to representing the lives of marginalised social groups. With the capability to invest, he works as both a producer and a director. His films are known for the unconventional materials he draws from as well as his unique perspectives.

Zhang Wei is talented in depicting the living conditions of China’s marginalised social groups in a plain and natural documentary style. The films Zhang Wei directed are imbued with an intense and innate social awareness. Such spontaneous awareness makes every film of his a terrific topic for controversy.

Underneath his seemingly plain narrative are often enormous social conflicts. From the constant conflicts between characters and the society, the audience see the most easily ignored things in the drastically changing Chinese society. Zhang Wei himself is a contradicted soul: hot-tempered and impatient as a person, yet his works illustrate his viewpoints lucidly and calmly, with certain stubbornness but deep humanistic sentiments.

Since 2010, the films produced by Zhang Wei, e.g. *Beijing Dream* (喜禾), *The Shadow Puppet Show of One Person* (一个人的皮影戏), *Factory Boss* (打工老板), and *Destiny* (喜禾), have gained attention from the critics, and triggered widespread debates.

**Commentary: ‘Children of the Stars’ (星星的孩子)**

Based on a true story Zhang Wei’s docudrama Destiny represents the trials of educating an autistic child in China from two perspectives. The first is a portrayal of the individual needs of an autistic child, which the mother assumes primary responsibility for. The second is a critique of the standards and requirements of the mainstream or “normal” education system and how this competitive environment does not take into account the needs of disadvantaged students.

In Destiny education is presented as the only path to an independent life. Whereas American films such as Rain Man (directed by Barry Levinson, 1988) or more recently Adam (directed by Max Mayer, 2009) seek to represent an individual’s experience of autism, Chinese films such as Breaking the Silence (漂亮妈妈) (directed by Sun Zhou, 2000), and now Destiny, making use of disorders as a means of sociopolitical critique. The protagonist, Tian Lin, represents an idealised image of motherhood as she tirelessly struggles for her child’s equal right to an education. In contrast, Xi He’s blue-collar father, Zhao Ju, is a passive figure who is content with the status quo, urges his wife to cease her struggle to have their son accepted into mainstream society.

Director Zhang Wei states that he sought to “express the motherhood topic through the life experience of an autistic child … as well as reflect the relationship between man and society from a humanistic care perspective.” The style of the dialogue is direct and emotive. In preparing the script director Zhang Wei pieced together parts of the dialogue from real-life accounts of an autistic student’s mother, other students’ parents, a school principal, and teachers so as to portray an “authentic and reasonable story”.

Like many so-called ‘sixth generation’ social realist art films, which focus on contemporary marginal figures in a naturalistic documentary style, there is a strain of didacticism that runs through the film.

As Zhang Wei states, “I use 98 minutes to foretell the whole life of a 9-year-old autistic child. I am exploring a destiny inherited from genes. I am also trying hard to show the life struggles of a mother facing a desperate situation.”
