## summary

In the spirit of his directorial debut, *Mama* (1991), about a disabled child and his mother, Zhang Yuan’s 2006 feature film returns to the theme of the plight of marginalised children. His second adaptation of a popular novel by Wang Shuo, *Could be Beautiful* (the first being the 2003 *I Love You*), the semi-autobiographical story of four-year old Qiangqiang reflects his recurring concern for individuals in trouble with Chinese socialist conventions of the late twentieth century. Similar narratives can be found playing out in *Beijing Bastards* (1993) and in *Sons* a film about a dysfunctional family with a father confined to a psychiatric institution and his increasingly alcoholic and disorderly sons. In *Little Red Flowers* these tensions between individual and community are intimately portrayed and satirised through the necessity of forming good and timely personal habits, and the difficulties of negotiating space for personal expression.

## synopsis

Qiangqiang has been abandoned to a Beijing residential nursery by a faceless father and a mother working out of town. Bed-wetting and unable to dress himself, he has a hard time conforming to the daily rhythms and regulations of the institution’s conditions. His domestic and hygienic behavior is found wanting by all around him who are invested in the school’s strict regimen and efficient operation. The ‘little red flowers’ of the title refer to the much-coveted rewards given to students who successfully subordinate themselves to the local discipline.

Qiangqiang’s b seemingly obstinate behaviours mean that he soon alienates his more conformist playmates and attracts the anger and censure of the long suffering headmistress, Mrs Li. Qiang’s own suffering and alienation emerge in an instinctual, rather than intentional defiance, which emerges in playground conflicts, in appropriating ‘little red flower’ as contraband, and the determination to control the timing of his own bowel movements.

## cinematography

Told effortlessly through the interactions of the children themselves, and the children and their guardians, the film is nevertheless a serious reflection on the struggle for independent action and creativity in a 1980s? China undergoing profound social change. Fairly traditional in its shooting techniques, the establishing ariel shot draws us in to a dilapidated Qing courtyard, where the parentless children are themselves the little red flowers playing in the ruins of former imperial splendor – the collective apparently triumphing against privilege.  Yet the camera moves at a very slow pace in the nursery to give a sense of the repressed atmosphere deliberately inculcated by the staff to maintain that group harmony; and then speeds up a little when the children are planning various unpredictable forms of insurrection, and then a great deal with intense action such as the inevitable bullying, or to create a sense of confusion amidst the pandemonium and  cacophony of random-running-around. Fast circling shots are used to set the errant child apart from the dominant majority and its group acts of suppression, ridicule and humiliation – increasing the sense of loneliness and confusion. Distant shots spying on the child, or turned on the teacher from behind windows and fences intensify the distances between the protagonists, and create suspicion and suspense. Still, there are moments of tenderness, of connection with the other children, even with the teachers, and they are not all unfeeling, nor uniformly strict. There is no explicit corporal punishment, and with what must be three carers to forty children we might feel some sympathy for the adults! This is not one of the horrendous orphanages that were the butt of international media attention a decade or two ago.

Where space is at a premium – the children are barracked up in their cradles nose to nose, head to toe  – what room is there for independent action? As a microcosm of the state, bottom wiping in the nursery is a military exercise performed to the whistle, an homology given explicit visual form as the children march in crocodile fashion past the soldiers on drill. But Qiangqiang runs in the opposite direction, always seeking out places and spaces to move in his own way, piss in his own time. The natural environment acts as a foil for the nursery endorsing his quest for freedom: the child walks alone in the snow, the wind blows his hair as he gallops on the makeshift merry-go-round horse, he escapes at night into the rain.

Where Sons used real life members of the dysfunctional family, in Zhang’s now familiar documentary style, in Little Red Flowers he draws out impressively naturalistic performances from the child actors no doubt faithfully capturing their own games, conflicts, and moments of introspection, rather than totally manufacturing the narrative. In fact there is very little narrative development, except to say that the final shot finds Qiangqiang intentionally isolating himself in the nearby temple gardens. We leave him curled up alone in a palatial, but barren, stone room, and wonder about what the future will bring for a child without friends, in a state of uncertainty. Zhang’s film capitalises on all the charm of well trained child actors, has a gooey sound track, and all the nostalgia of a cultural revolution setting in an outpost of the Forbidden City, yet somehow manages not to betray its deeper messages about how individuals negotiate the state demands for conformity, then as now.
