## summary

Guangdong, China. The economy is racing forward, carrying the sex industry along with it. The idealistic boss of Chang’e *Sauna* and his hard-working employees seek to transform their enterprise into a modern “entertainment kingdom”. Apart from being the name of the sauna/brothel, and the unmanned moon spaceship that China launched in Oct 2010, the film's Chinese title Chang’e refers to The Lady in the Moon, a goddess from Chinese mythology who endows her worshippers with great beauty. There are many myths about Chang’e, but since antiquity most involve tales of how she was expelled from Heaven with her husband, Houyi, who shot the nine suns out of the sky. They also involve her consuming alchemical drugs and getting so high she bounces up to the moon. Once there she is trapped for eternity with the rabbit who is compounding the drugs of immortality. These are the themes of this film, entrapment, intoxication, and dreams.


## synopsis

The girls, who are managed by Li, who has a young son by a man who left her, include wannabe singer Xiao Meng from Sichuan province and Pink. A friend of Li, Leizi, pimps for them. Wu's protector is businessman Lin, one of whose friends, Song, requests a virgin from him. Wu tells Lei to find one and the latter recruits factory girl Hou. However, when Hou runs away afterwards, Lei demands an extra RMB 100,000 (US$15,000) to recompense his investment in her, and Lin has him arrested by the police.
In the end, Wu manages to resurrect his rattling business while some of the girls leave the place. For the ones staying everything will remain the same in Wu’s brothel, an island detached from the harsh reality of factory sweat-shops and piece work.   

The movie has many hilarious moments, with the ex-pro Li running a training course where she teaches the girls how to moan and fake orgasms and Mr. Wu waltzing away in the sex-toy shop while his assistant chooses some dildos and checks their batteries. The relationship between Mr. Wu and his girls imparts a tone of warmth to the whole movie. His fatherly concern and caring towards the girls manifests itself in many absurdly humorous scenes, like the one in which he buys sadomasochist accessories for the girls to boost their business. He then shows the dolled-up girls how to use them while he himself tries on a nice piece of gag.

## cinematography

Born in the Northeast, Zou Peng now moves way down south to Guangdong for this second feature, in most respects the polar opposite to his first, *A North Chinese Girl* (Dongbei dongbei, 2009) set in his hometown of Harbin. Where Girl was dark, wintry and self-consciously arty in style, *Sauna* is bright, sweaty and sassy, reflecting its setting in the southern, Cantonese-dominated melting-pot. Aided by master cinematographer Yu Lik-wai (Jia Zhangke’s staple director of photography) he offers a stylised and dreamlike take on the artificial universe of the brothel, with his seamily-coloured, saturated photography of interiors. A smoothly flowing, impressionistic poem about the mundane everyday life of a brothel, together with sharp ironies about the mindset of the entrepreneurs of the new China, subtly photographed with a mildly rippling musical score.

Audiences tend to be sharply divided on this film. In a Q & A with the producer, Chen Zhiheng 陈挚恒, he claimed that they were ‘telling it as it is’, and from the women’s point of view. Certainly we get to know the characters of the women, and the ways in which they are following their dreams which prevents them from becoming the ‘commodified bodies’ that they arguably represent. But this is no feminist film. It plays straight to the fantasies of the heterosexual men it simultaneously lampoons, especially in the poolside girly promenade through a long pink tunnel….. Compare to Xu Tong’s Wheat Harvest, the hardcore documentary of prostitutes in the back streets of Beijing.
